    "# Installing Quarto (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open source technical publishing system for creating beautiful articles, websites, blogs, books, slides, and more. It is kind of like LaTeX but more modern and content is written in markdown. That's great because that's exactly what is used in Jupyter notebooks. Since Quarto supports Python, R, and Julia, we can turn our notebooks into this beautiful documentation website effortlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks can be converted to HTML, PDF, markdown, and TEX files. Quarto uses `pandoc` to do this. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Quarto, follow the instructions listed at <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>.\n",
    "While you can preview the generated site locally, Github offers free hosting for every repository (known as [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) and Actions which allow you to automate Continuous Integration (CI) tests on each push/pull request, and website deployment. [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are defined in `.github/workflows/name-of-action.yml` and you can have more than one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, you don't need to install Quarto to start contributing since the documentation site deployment is automated when branch `main` is updated. But if you want to see how your updates render on local webpage, you'll need it. \n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note title=\"What about Documenter.jl?\"}\n",
    "You can use Quarto with Documenter.jl to document your Julia packages. Since notebooks contain markdown, these can be converted to `.md` format for Documenter.jl. See <https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html> and\n",
